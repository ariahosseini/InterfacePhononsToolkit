# InterfacePhononsToolkit — a Python Set of Library for Computing Thermal Behavior at the Interfaces

<div align="justify">
{\emph{InterfacePhononsToolkit}} is a computational framework for computing phonons behavior at the interfaces. This includes a set of libraries to generate phonon wavepacket, a generic Monte Carlo ray tracing model to demonstrate anticorrelated heat current in materials containing nanoscale pores -- see my recently published paper \cite{de2020heat}, a set of libraries to analyze lattice vibrational behavior in inharmonious structures, etc. The code has an interface with \href{https://lammps.sandia.gov/}{LAMMPS} molecular dynamics simulator. The derivation and implementation of the codes are done in a clever way to minimize the computational expenses while enhancing the accuracy.
